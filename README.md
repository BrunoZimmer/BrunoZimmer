# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Bruno Zimmer and I'm a eletrical engineering student! Hope u enjoy my GitHub :satisfied:

### Something about me Nowadays

Today I'm a reasearcher at my university, UFRGS. I research about microeletronic, more especifically, non-volatile memories. :nerd_face:

I got into university in 2018, so i hope to graduate in 2022.

### Something about my programming trajectory

You can see since my first project in C Language here, a tetris(I love tetris, you can try to challenge, just try:smiling_imp:), C was my first language, I learned at the university with the best teacher that I ever had.

<!--
Some time later I start coding in Python by myself and built two simple projects that I really like, a Snake and a Pacman, I love games.:video_game::space_invader:
-->

And then, in 2020, during the pandemic, I did the Rocketseat's Starter Pack to learn Javascript, and I love it, so I did the GoStack Bootcamp, where I improve my skills in JavaScript and learned Node.JS, React and React Native! :purple_heart: :rocket: :purple_heart:
