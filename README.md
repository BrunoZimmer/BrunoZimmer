# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Bruno Zimmer and I am a student of electrical engineering in Brazil (UFRGS) and general engineering in France (Ecole Centrale Lille)! Hope you like my GitHub :satisfied:

### Something about me

I was a researcher at my university in Brazil, UFRGS. I do research on microelectronics, more specifically, non-volatile memories. : geek face:

I joined UFRGS in 2018 and in 2021 I joined Ecole Centrale Lille

### Something about my programming trajectory

You can see my first project in C language here, a tetris (I love tetris, you can try to challenge me, just try: smiling_imp :), C was my first language, I learned it at university from the best teacher I ever knew had.

Some time later I start coding in Python by myself and built two simple projects that I really like, a Snake and a Pacman, I love games.:video_game::space_invader:

And then in 2020, during the pandemic, I made the Rocketseat Starter Pack to learn Javascript, and I loved it, so I did the GoStack Bootcamp, where I honed my Typescript skills and learned Node.JS, React and React Native! : purple_heart:: rocket:: purple_heart:
